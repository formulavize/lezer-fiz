# lezer-fiz
This is the fiz grammar for the [lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net) parser system.

**fiz** is a functionally inspired language for describing workflows in [formulavize](https://github.com/formulavize/formulavize). It borrows many language constructs from [javascript](https://github.com/lezer-parser/javascript) and [CSS](https://github.com/lezer-parser/css).
